## Version 1
Earlier this year, I switched from Spectrum intenet to ATT Fiber. I was hestiant to make the switch due to ATT's reputation in my area, but I'd heard
that the fiber service was much better than their older intenet offerings, so I decided to give it a shot. For the first couple months, everything was 
wonderful. The speeds were great - 1000mbps up and down - and it seemed rock solid. But, then I started noticing apps disconnecting on my computer. Icons
would grey out for a second, then come back. It was usually fast - off and back on within seconds - but it began to happen more frequently. Songs I'd be 
streaming would grey out, then come back, almost flickering sometimes from the disconnects. While it wasn't impacting my work directly (yet), it was annyoying,
so I decided I needed to start logging the outages - both to see if there was a pattern and to have some hard data to give to the ISP if it continued.

Of course, I could manually log each outage with pen and paper, but I'm a programmer, so of course I decided to automate it. I debated for a bit on what language
to use. Any number of them would have work, but I'd been learning Go this year and this gave me a nice small project to work on. That decided, I just had to figure 
out the best way to detect that the internet was down. Do I simply ping a server? Do a HTTP request periodically with a short timeout? Check packets at a lower level?

For my first version, I decided to just do a simple request to `google.com` every 10 seconds and write the results to a log file. It was a very simple program that just 
used the standard library for part of the process. I added custom flags so that I could change the interval, the log file, and whether to print the results to `STDOUT` or not.
After that, I made a simple infinite `for` loop that would check the connection and log the status based on the results of the request.

The log file was very simple, but got across the information I was trying to convery to the ISP. It was just a date and time and a status message:
```txt
2024/08/25 10:47:23 Internet connection lost
2024/08/25 10:47:43 Internet connection restored
2024/08/25 11:04:44 Internet connection lost
2024/08/25 11:04:54 Internet connection restored
2024/08/25 11:20:22 Internet connection lost
2024/08/25 11:20:48 Internet connection restored
2024/08/25 11:31:53 Internet connection restored
2024/08/25 11:35:42 Internet connection lost
2024/08/25 11:36:02 Internet connection restored
```

The full implementation is only 69 lines of code, but it's been very helpful seeing the amount of disconnects happening.

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"
)

const (
	defaultCheckInterval = 10
	defaultLogFile       = "connection_log.txt"
	testURL              = "http://www.google.com"
)

func main() {
	intervalPtr := flag.Int("interval", defaultCheckInterval, "Check interval in seconds")
	flag.IntVar(intervalPtr, "i", defaultCheckInterval, "Check interval in seconds (shorthand)")

	logFilePtr := flag.String("logfile", defaultLogFile, "Log file path")
	flag.StringVar(logFilePtr, "l", defaultLogFile, "Log file path (shorthand)")

	printOutputPtr := flag.Bool("print", false, "Print output to console")
	flag.BoolVar(printOutputPtr, "p", false, "Print output to console (shorthand)")

	flag.Parse()

	checkInterval := time.Duration(*intervalPtr) * time.Second

	file, err := os.OpenFile(*logFilePtr, os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	logger := log.New(file, "", log.LstdFlags)

	if *printOutputPtr {
		fmt.Printf("Monitoring internet connection. Check interval: %v, Log file: %s\n", checkInterval, *logFilePtr)
	}

	var lastStatus bool
	for {
		connected := checkConnection()

		if !connected && lastStatus {
			logger.Println("Internet connection lost")

			if *printOutputPtr {
				fmt.Println("Internet connection lost")
			}
		} else if connected && !lastStatus {
			logger.Println("Internet connection restored")
			if *printOutputPtr {
				fmt.Println("Internet connection restored")
			}
		}

		lastStatus = connected
		time.Sleep(checkInterval)
	}
}

func checkConnection() bool {
	_, err := http.Get(testURL)
	return err == nil
}
```
